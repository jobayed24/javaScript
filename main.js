// if you have list of care name and you store the data with seperate single variable 
// then you will do it 

const car1="volvo";
const car2="saab";
const car3="BMW";

/// it's easy to print the specific value but seems you have 300 value then what happend you should use an array array is the varibale where you can store hug value doing seperate throught comma


// infortent things is array have squre brackets where you put all value with make theme seperate
const car=["volvo","saab","BMW"];

// you can find the specific value through reference index number

console.log(car[2]);


// it's common practice to declare array with const keyword
